## 🔄 Pull Request Flow

### 🔁 For Contributors

- All PRs **must be based on `develop`** unless hotfixing `main`.
- Branch names should start with one of the allowed prefixes from the table above.
- PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Keep your PR focused and small for easier review.

### ✅ Merge Rules

- `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `refactor/*`, `test/*`, `docs/*`, `ci/*`, `perf/*`, `build/*`, `style/*` → merge into `develop` after review & CI pass.
- `develop` → `release/x.y` at sprint end for release prep.
- `release/x.y` → `main` after QA and approval.
- `hotfix/*` → `main` → `develop` immediately.

## 🔐 Branch Protection Rules

| Branch       | Protection                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `main`       | Required PR, review, status checks      |
| `release/*`  | Only maintainers can merge              |
| `develop`    | PR required, minimum 1 review           |
| others       | No restriction, delete after merge      |

---

## 🗓️ Merge Schedule

| Action                      | Frequency            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| `feature/*` → `develop`     | As soon as ready     |
| `develop` → `release/x.y`   | Weekly or per sprint |
| `release/x.y` → `main`      | After QA/approval    |
| `hotfix/*` → `main`         | Immediately if needed|

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Policy

- Merged feature, fix, chore, refactor, test, docs, ci, perf, build, style branches **must be deleted immediately**.
- `release/*` branches are deleted **after tagging**.
- `hotfix/*` branches are merged and deleted **immediately**.
- Consider automating branch deletion using GitHub Settings or scripts.

---

## 📈 Do’s and Don’ts

### Do

- Use **clear, descriptive branch names** with allowed prefixes.
- Open **small, focused PRs** for faster review.
- Follow **commit and PR title conventions**.
- Sync with `develop` frequently.

### Don’t

- Push large or unrelated changes in a single PR.
- Merge into `main` or `release/*` without approval.
- Use branch names outside the approved prefixes.
- Forget to delete branches after merge.
